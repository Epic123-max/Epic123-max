I am a tech enthusiast and a beginner with a clear vision. I am teaching myself how the world of infrastructure works because I want to become a professional DevOps or Cloud Engineer.
🚀 My Focus (Learning)

    ☁️ Cloud: Learning the basics of AWS/Azure.
    ⚙️ Automation: Learning CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
    🐧 Systems: Learning Linux (Bash) and Python scripting.
    📦 Containers: Learning how to use Docker.

🎯 My Goal
My goal is to master the world of Cloud and DevOps through hard work and self-study. I am dedicated to building my own projects, solving technical challenges, and growing my skills step by step until I can manage complex systems on my own.

"Focused on growth, driven by automation."
